"I know we're just friends, but would you like to have a sleepover with me?"
"I love sleeping next to you, but waking up next to you is even better."
"I love the way you look when you're sleeping, peaceful and serene."
"I may be tired, but I can't fall asleep without hearing your voice."
"I need a nap, but I'd much rather have one with you."
I never knew how much I needed a good night's sleep until I met you.
I never knew how much I needed someone to cuddle with until I met you.
I never knew how much I needed someone to hold me until I met you.
I never thought I'd find someone who could match my sleeping schedule until I met you.
I want to be the first thing you see when you wake up and the last thing you think about before you fall asleep.
I want to be the one who helps you sleep like a baby every night.
"I want to be the one who you hold close and never let go, even in your sleep."
I want to be the one who you think about before you fall asleep and after you wake up.
I want to be the one you dream about every night.
I want to be your pillow so I can support you through all your dreams.
I want to be your sleeping beauty and wake up to your true love's
I want to be your sleepwalking partner for life.
I want to be your teddy bear and cuddle you all night long.
I want to fall asleep holding your hand and wake up to your kisses.
I want to fall asleep in your arms and wake up to your smile every day.
I want to fall asleep in your arms and wake up to your sweet kisses.
I want to fall asleep listening to the sound of your heartbeat.
I want to fall asleep with you and wake up to the smell of coffee and breakfast.
I want to fall asleep with you in my arms and wake up to your beautiful smile.
I want to nap with you like there's no tomorrow.
"If napping were a sport, I'd be a gold medalist - and you'd be my prize."
"If you were a nap, I'd never want to wake up."
"I'll bring the snacks and you bring the laughter, and we'll have a sleepover we'll never forget."
"I'm a big fan of naps, but I'd rather have one with you."
"I'm not a morning person, but I'd wake up early just to see you."
I'm wide awake just thinking about you.
Let's cuddle until we fall asleep and see where our dreams take us.
Let's have a sleepover and make some unforgettable memories together.
"Let's spend the night together, just talking, laughing, and enjoying each other's company."
"Let's stay up all night talking, since we can't sleep anyway."
Let's take a nap together and forget about the world for a while.
Let's take a nap together and see where it takes us.
Let's turn our sleepless nights into something unforgettable together.
"My bed feels empty without you, that's why I can't sleep."
Sleep with me and I promise you'll have sweet dreams.
Sleep with me and I'll be the blanket you never knew you needed.
Sleep with me and I'll keep you warm all night long.
Sleep with me and I'll make sure you never wake up feeling lonely again.
Sleep with me and you'll wake up feeling rested and refreshed.
Sleeping with you is like being in a cozy cocoon of love.
Sleeping with you is like being in a dream that I never want to wake up from.
Sleeping with you is like being in a magical fairy tale.
"Sleeping with you is like being in a magical, mystical world of love."
"Sleeping with you is like being in a peaceful, serene dream world."
"Sleeping with you is like being in a soft, fluffy cloud."
"Sleeping with you is like being in a soft, warm bed of love."
Sleeping with you is like being in a warm embrace that I never want to let go of.
"Sleeping with you is like being in a warm, cozy hug."
"Sleeping with you is like being in a warm, loving embrace."
"Sleeping with you is like being in a warm, snuggly cocoon of love."
Sleeping with you is like being in a world that's only filled with love.
Sleeping with you is like being on a cloud in heaven.
"Sleeping with you is like being wrapped in a warm, cozy blanket."
Sleeping without you feels like a lonely abyss.
Sleeping without you is like sleeping without a pillow - uncomfortable and lonely.
Sleepless nights are worth it when I'm thinking about you.
Waking up next to you is the highlight of my day.
Want to come over for a sleepover and let me prove that chivalry isn't dead?
Want to have a sleepover and see where the night takes us?
"You and me, a bottle of wine, and a cozy sleepover - sounds perfect, doesn't it?"
"You have a way of making even the most mundane moments, like falling asleep, feel special."
You make even the most restless nights feel restful with your presence.
You make falling asleep feel like the most natural thing in the world.
"You make me feel like a kid again, sleeping soundly and without a care in the world."
"You make me feel like I'm home, even when we're sleeping in a new place."
You make me feel safe and cozy like a warm blanket.
You make my heart race even when we're fast asleep.
"You must be a nap, because I'm feeling sleepy just thinking about you."
You must be the reason why I can't fall asleep.
"You're like a nap - a quick rest, but always refreshing."
You're like a nap - always able to lift my spirits and make me feel better.
You're like a nap - always there to make my day better.
"You're like a nap - short, sweet, and always satisfying."
You're like a nap - the perfect way to recharge and feel rejuvenated.
"You're my cozy blanket on a cold, winter's night."
"You're my dream come true, even when I'm not sleeping."
"You're my dream come true, even when I'm not sleeping."
You're my favorite dream and my reality all at once.
"You're my heart's desire, even when I'm fast asleep."
"You're my knight in shining armor, even when we're sleeping."
You're my lullaby that puts me to sleep every night.
"You're my source of comfort and happiness, even in my sleep."
You're my sweet dream and my beautiful nightmare all rolled into one.
You're the first person I think of when I wake up and the last person I think of before I go to bed.
You're the melody to my sleepy symphony.
You're the missing piece to my bedtime routine.
You're the missing piece to my nap puzzle.
You're the missing piece to my perfect night's sleep.
You're the missing puzzle piece to my sleepless nights.
You're the one who brings light to my dark nights.
You're the one who brings light to my darkest days and nights.

You're the one who makes me excited to wake up every morning.
"You're the one who makes me feel alive, even when I'm fast asleep."
"You're the one who makes me feel loved and cherished, even in my sleep."
"You're the one who makes me feel safe and loved, even in my dreams."
You're the one who makes my dreams sweeter and my life better.
You're the only one who can make my restless nights peaceful again.
You're the only thing that can cure my insomnia.
You're the only thing that can put my mind and body at ease.
You're the pillow that I always want to rest my head on.
You're the reason why I wake up every morning with a smile on my face.
You're the sunrise that I look forward to every morning.
You're the sweetest dream that I never want to wake up from.
You're the yawn that I can't help but catch every time I'm around you.

Our love is like the waterfall. We make it in rainbows.
Sometimes you just got to go with the flow. A date night with me by the fall?
Surrender to the flow.
The power of a waterfall is nothing but a lot of drips working together.
There is a waterfall in every wet dream.
Things are really looking up aren't they?

I will never say never! (I will fight)/ I will fight till forever! (make it right)/ Whenever you knock me down/ I will not stay on the ground
I wish we had another time. I wish we had another place. But everything we have is stuck in the moment. And there's nothing my heart can do to fight with time and space. Because I'm still stuck in the moment with you.

"I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool. What you expect me to do? I'm just trying to find, find, find- the sweet love of mine."
"I'm not Justin Bieber, why do you say girl, I love you more than once ."
"I'm reaching out for you. Get me out here in the water and I… I'm overboard. And I need your love to pull me up. I can't swim on my own. It's too much. Feels like I'm drowning without your love. So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver."
I'm related to Justin Bieber ? (Why?) Whenever you close to me my heart beats and want to scream !
I'm running out of time. Where is my runaway love? Searching low and high… Know that I'm not giving up. I'd give it all up for her. But it'll never be enough. I won't stop until I find my runaway love….
"In my head, we're already together."
"It's crazy to me, I even see you in my dreams."
"It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven, because when I stare in your eyes it couldn't be better."

"Oh, for you I would have done whatever. And I just can't believe we ain't together. And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losing you. I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring. And I'm in pieces, baby fix me. And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream. I'm going down, down, down, down. And I just can't believe my first love won't be around."
"Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish/ There's no way that I could share you/ That would break my heart to pieces/ Honestly the truth is…/ If I could just die in your arms/ I wouldn't mind."
"Oh, it's supposed to be some give and take, I know. But you're only taking and not giving anymore. So what do I do? Because I still love you… And you're the only one who can save me."
"Only if you give, give your first dance to me/ Girl, I promise I'll be gentle/ I know we gotta do it slowly/ If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it)/ I'm going cherish every moment/ because it only happens once, once in a lifetime"
"So crazy is this thing we call love. And now that we've got it, we just can't give up."
"So don't fear. Don't you worry about a thing. I am here, by you (I'll never let you go)."
Step to the beat of my heart/ I don't need a whole lot/ But for you I admit I/ I'd rather give you the world/ Or we can share mine/ I know I won't be the first one/ giving you all this attention/ Baby listen/ I just need somebody to love.
"Take my hand. Let's just dance. Watch my feet. Follow me. Don't be scared, girl, I'm here. If you didn't know, this is love."
"Tell me what you like yeah tell me what you don't/ I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe."
"There's a dream that I've been chasing. Want so badly for it to be reality. And when you hold my hand, and I understand that it's meant to be. Because, baby, when you're with me it's like an angel came by and took me to heaven. Because when I stare in your eyes it couldn't be better"
"They say that hate has been sent so let loose the talk of love. Before they outlaw the kiss, baby, give me one last hug."
Wanna Get Biebered?
"We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight/ I wanna show you all the finer things in life/ So just forget about the world, be young tonight/ I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya."
"We play celebrity dogs, Papillon Justin Bieber, you can be Kardashian Boxer and I will bury my bone in your backyard !"
"Why can't I find you love of mine when you're standing in front of my face? Oh I, I must be blind. How did I let you get away?"
"You are my love, you are my heart/ And we will never ever ever be apart/ Are we an item? Girl, quit playing/ We're just friends, what are you saying?"
"You know you love me, I know you care. Just shout whenever, and I'll be there. You are my love, you are my heart. And we will never, ever, ever be apart."
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light.

"You're beautiful, you know it, I think it's time you show it."
You're imperfectly perfect.

"Nice boots, wanna fuck?"
No need to be alarmed ma'am. That's not a pistol in my pocket.
"No, it can't be bought it's something you're born with. That's what country is."
"Oh, baby, that's not a pistol. I'm damn happy to see you."
"Oh, baby, when I'm around you I can't think straight."
"Romantic comedies and cuddling? No, thanks. I'd rather ride in your truck and have sex."

I'll put the wind in your sails if you raise my mast.
I'm not much for boats. But I can see myself in a ship with you.
"In every turn of the boat, it felt as if I’ve found you somewhere on the pages of my book."
Is that a boat paddle in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?
It’s the motion of the ocean not the size of the wave.
"It's not about the size of the boat, it's about how you sail you."
"It's not the size of the boat, but how fast it sinks."
I've got something you can catch.
"Just like the boat, my heart swings back and forth to the oceans every time I see you."
Let this boat be our shelter under the stars.
Looks like your boat needs some seamen and I have the perfect crew.
"Nice boat, wanna come aboard?"
"Nice dock, mind if I park my boat in it?"
No strong wave nor angry sea could ever break a sturdy and firm ship.
"On a boat, in a car, with your toes all curled - Oh, the places we'll go when I rock your world!"
"Once you get on my boat, you will never need another vessel."
Permission to board?
"Remove all your worries in life, throw them in the sea and let them sink deeply at the bottom."
"Row row row you boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, I can make you scream."
Take care of this boat for it will surely take care of you during the stormy nights.
These dark clouds and strong wind could not hinder my boat in coming to you my love.
"This boat is like me, I could save you in your stormy days and darkest nights."
This ship could take you a thousand miles and could take you toward my heart.
Wanna put your anchor in my harbor?
Want to bounce my pole up?
Want to go back to me ship and rock the boat?
We are all like a boat. We keep on sailing that waves don’t matter anymore.
"We don’t know when the boat will flip and toss us apart, but we should keep on sailing."
When I see you my main sail rise.
"Why don't you come back to my place, and we can do some world-shaking of our own."
"With you, I could travel the whole world with just a boat for our love will make it possible."

This is how I roll.
Wanna go for a spin on my rail? I promise to be gentle. 
Wanna go skating on my love rail tonight?
You make me weak at the knee pads.
You're pretty good at skating. I'm pretty good at kissing. Let's see what happens when we put them together.
A quad cork isn’t the only thing I’ll be nailing today.
"After making my tongue stiff all day, I conclude by declaring you a boot fitter."
"Are your hands cold? Don't worry, my pants are warm."
"Babe, you have a fiancée? No worries because I got the warms socks for your cold feet."

Don't miss this moment because I bribed that handsome lift guy to halt the ride.
Don't worry if you lose a pole; I always take 3.
Getting on this chair with you was definitely the lift I needed.
Girl I want to carry down the mountain after I sweep you off your feet.
"Girl, I want to plow more than the snow today."
"Girl, stop making me wanting to jump off the chairlift, because you are making me falling for you."
"Girl, want to ride the steepest slope of this mountain?"
Have you noticed my new backflip skills? Because my head is all over the heels for you.
Hey baby! Come and join me in this lane so you can leave the single line.
"How do you clean snow from your goggles? Because I can just use my tongue, for mine."
How much do these skis weigh? Enough to break the ice.
How much does a chairlift weight? Enough to break the ice.
I bombed off a 40 ft cliff yesterday. People say size doesn't matter because they don't get any.
I bribed the lift guy to stop the ride. We might as well get to know each other.
I didn't know angels need to use the chair lifts too.
"I didn't know angels needed a chairlift. Are you getting off at the top, or continuing to Heaven?"
"I hope the lift is secure, I think I'm falling for you."
"I hope this lift is secure, because I'm falling for your love."
I hope you find me under an avalanche because I could use some probing.
I just discovered that angels also need a chairlift.
I like it steep and deep. How about you?
"I might be on the wrong chairlift, because it's taking me to heaven with an angel."
I noticed you were in the singles line earlier.
"I think I just discovered that I am a snowflake, because I just fell for you tonight."
I think my heart just did a double cork 1080 and got 15 feet of air out of my throat.
I wanna ski down your steep slope.
I will nose butter your box if you lip slide my rail.
I won’t pull your pass if you duck my rope.
I wonder why the snow was wetter than it used to be.
"If you get caught by an avalanche, don't worry I'm a certified pro at probing."
"If you hurt your knee, you can elevate it on my shoulder."
I'm glad I bought spare socks… You're giving me cold feet.
I'm trained and equipped to clear snow. That's why you'll hear people saying I'm a pro at heavy-duty ploughing.
I'm wearing knee pads and I'm not afraid to use them.
Is your coulior as tight as they say it is?
"It's a pity I can't see your beautiful face through my glasses. If I could, I would have shown you, my dearest love, at first sight."
Leave the mountain because you have melted all the snow.
Let me know if you would like to continue to heaven or you desire to get off to the top spot.
"Looks like they have been doing avalanche control, because I just found a bombshell!"
Maybe I'm a snowflake… I think I'm falling for you.
Most ladies are in the single line. Do you wanna join them?
My love for you is like the avalanche. Your love makes me fall all over you.
My rail slides really well.
"Not to brag, but I've got pretty amazing edge control."
Promise to show your love to me so I can rescue you from the single line.
Sharing body heat with you is the best gift I have got this week.
So many ladies on the single line but your beauty is incomparable to them.
"Sorry, but you need to leave the mountain. You're melting all the snow."
Starring at your attractive facial outlook made me have a greater edge control today.
Stick with me you won't just ride black diamonds. You will wear them.
The lift guy just stopped the ride so we can know more about ourselves.
The snow was wetter than usual today. Wonder why.
The snow way of life is with you.
"The weather is calling for 5 inches, well because they haven't seen the 12 inches I have for you tonight."
The weather's calling for 5 inches… But I can show you 12.
There's snow way I'm not getting your number!
They say I've got an ava-lung because I never come up for air.
They're saying the piste is gonna freeze and get real hard tonight. Do you know what else will?
"This lift is too slow, I know a much better way to raise us all the way up to Cloud 9."
This Pow isn't as sweet as you are.
This snow pack isn’t the only thing that’s hard
"Uh oh, it's getting colder. We might need to share body heat."
Want to see my new backflip? I'm doing it right now I'm head over heels!
What’s your DIN?
Which one of these trails leads to your heart?
Why is it so windy? I think you're blowing me away!
"Without your presence, my skiing activity would have been extremely boring."
"Woah, have they been doing avalanche control? I found a bombshell!"
You know what I have in common with the snow? Eight inches.
"You know, I can't see through these goggles at all, but if I could, I'm sure it'd be love at first sight."
"You know, I've got an extra pair of knee pads in my lodge."
You making my stomach do quad corks.
"You must be a boot fitter, you're making my tongue stiff."
You must be a ski because I want to ride you.
Your eyes are bluer than the sky from this skiing mountain.
Your face or mine?
Your love is beginning to blow me away.
"Any time you fall, I'll be there to catch you."
Are you a hard climb? Because I love the challenge.
Are you a rock? Because I wanna climb on top of you.
Are you ready for your first ascent?
"Babe I climb a lot, because I know how to handle them jugs."
Babe you ever fell? Well you will soon be a true screamer tonight.
"Babe, it's time to caving inside you."
"Babe, you need no protection when you got my bolts."
Baby you got the perfect route for me.
"Beautiful slopers, mind if I slap them?"
Belay and chill?
Belay before belaid.
Belays before baes.
Belaytionships before relationships.
Boy are you the corporate ladder? Because I'm climbing on top of you in my dreams.
Can I put my nuts on your rack?
Can you hold my rope and give it a tug from time to time when it gets a bit of slack.
Can you hold these nuts for a sec?
Check out my nuts.
Climb On.
Come back to my place and I'll show you the true meaning of plug and chug.
Could you give me a catch? Because I like to be on top.
Could you prompt me? I'd like to know the directions to your heart.
Do you climb? Because I would want you to get on me.
"Do you got a mirror in your pocket? Huh, I thought I just saw myself climbing in your pants!"
Do you like classic root? Because I got mine long and hard.
Do you mind if I slip my rope under your route?
Do you think that jug is too high to reach? Well I think yours is just the right height.
Don’t ration your passion.
Don't worry I got top-rope certified.
Ever do it on a portoledge?
"Every time you fall, I'll catch you."
"Excuse me, can you spot me? I think I'm falling for you."
"Gal, you are amazingly gorgeous... can i get a pic of you climbing?"
Girl are you a 9c? Because I can't hold on to your curves.
"Girl, is your harness double backed? Cuz I had to double back to get a look at you."
Her favorite technique is stemming.
"Here, let me chalk up those jugs for you."
"Hey babe, give me some beta on how I could onsight your rack!"
"Hey baby, you workin' that crack!"
Hey can i put my nuts or your rack?
"Hey girl, I'll let you top rope off of my lead."
"Hey girl, wanna belay me?"
"Hey I just realized this, but you look a lot like my next belay partner."
"Hey, climb here often?"
"Hey, how about give me some beta on how I could onsight your rack."
"Hey, I was wondering if you could show me your favorite crag?"
I could rest on those jugs all day.
"I do a lot of traditional climbing, but if you want to lead me somewhere, I'll follow."
I got the dyno move babe.
I have a tuber you can use anytime you want.
I have an oversize Friend in my pants!
"I hope you have your chalk bag on, you’re making my palms sweaty."
I just built a climbing gym in my pants and would like to offer your a chance at a first ascent.
I just met you. And this is crazy. But here's my number... Belay me maybe?
I know if I want to impress you I’ll have to be a little boulder.
I like the way you finger that crack.
"I like your slopers, can you teach me how to grip those?"
I literally trust you with my life.
"I play dangerously, I can do edging without protection all night long."
I see two nice lookin' rocks I'd like you to grab.
"I usually use protection, but I'll make an exception."
I won’t take your love for granite.
I’m falling for you.
I’m hanging onto you.
I'd love to jam that crack
"If I told you I was falling hard, would you be my belayer?"
"If I was a boulder problem, would you flash me?"
If I was a wall would you climb me all night?
"If you play hard to get, I’ll have to make you my project."
"If you show my your rack, I’ll show you my nuts."
I'll belay you all night long.
I'm going to be topping out on you all  night.
I'm really good at hand-jams.
"I'm willing to jam my fist into just about any crack, baby."
Is that a mirror in your pocket? Because I see myself climbing into your pants!
Is that a stalagmite feature or are you just happy to see me?
Is that your belay device or are you just happy to see me?
Is your favorite technique stemming?
"I've got all the hardware you need to be your real mountain man, if you know what I mean."
Just a climber looking to get belayed.
"Keep me tight, I’m going to layback and work the crack"
Let me heel hook your shoulder.
Let’s take our belayationship to the next level.
Let's hook up.
Looking to get belaid?
"Miss, could you prompt me? Then I'll know the directions to your heart."
My nuts would fit perfectly in your crack.
"My portaledge sleeps two, you know."
Need a belay?
Nice rack.
Nothing turns me on more than a long hard rock and some tuber.
Rock under the fingers beats a rock on a finger.
So do you want to go climbing for a couple of hours and then screw?
"Some climbers get off soloing; me, I'd rather play with your rack."
Soo...I have a 6 foot wingspan.
"Spread your legs, and trust the rubber."
"Sure you can figure 8, but can you follow through?"
"The thing I like about cracks: The deeper you get, the better it feels. "
They don't call me a hard man for nothing.
"Those must be climbing pants, because I would love to climb in your pants."
"Usually I lead, but I would follow you anywhere."
Violets are blue. Roses are red. I hear that you give really good belay.
Wanna get tied up and high?
Wanna heel hook my shoulders?
Wanna see my hanging belay?
"Want to get high, get hot, and get sweaty?... I need a climbing partner."
Want to restuff my chalk balls while I recalibrate your GPS?
Watch me babe while I beat on this pin.
We’re a perfect match.
Weren't you on the cover of rock and ice last month?
Why don’t you let me rock your world?
"With my strong hands and fingers, I can give shoulder and back massages all night long."
You belayed me off my feet.
You had me at On Belay.
You had me at rock climbing.
"You have a beautiful rack, mind if I poke around?"
You have really nice forearms.
"You know, I've always found bruised legs, short nails and three days without a shower sexy."
You missing a set of anchors? Because I would like to go in hard.
You’ve heel hooked my heart.
Your harness isn’t the only one who can hug you tight.
"Your rubbers are looking a little used, I have some new ones, wanna try?"
"Angels could fly, but I didn't know they could run."
"Apart from being a running gear model, what do you do for a living?"
"Babe, all the trail leads straight to you."
"Babe, I am looking for a running buddy, for the rest of my life."
"Babe, my starting gun is going to make your heart beat fast tonight."
"Babe, want to check out my spikes in private?"
"Babe, you are so good at jogging, you came straight for my heart."
"Babe, you are the best compression gear because you made my blood flow."
"Babe, you have been running through my mind all day."
Call me miles because I want you to complete me every round.
Can you run with me so I can tell my friends I've ran with an angel?
Did you get lost on your run? Because heaven is a long way from here.
"Distance equals velocity times time, or we could just simply race to the finish line."
Do you believe in love at first sight? Or should I run by again?
Do you believe love at first sight? Or do I need to run faster to lap you again.
"Do you jog, you better stay hydrated and I got some very nice liquid."
Do you know I am great at karate? ‘Cause I got a great finishing kick in bed.
Do you like speed work? 'Cause I'm always down for a quickie.
Do you run track? Because you are running laps around my heart.
Do you run track? Cause I relay like you!
Excuse me… Do these shoes make me look fast?
Girl are we doing high altitude training because you just took my breath away!
Girl are you a runner? Because I will stretch you out tonight.
Girl you are rocking this run.
"Girl you got the perfect running form, want to check out my perfect form in bed?"
"Girl, I want to run all the way with you."
"Girl, you inspired me to run faster when you passed me, following you from behind was all I needed today."
"Hey I love your shoes, they would look even better if they were running alongside me."
"Hey, are those running tights you have on reflective? Because I can see myself in your pants."
"Hold up, I don't want to fall for anyone else but you, so let me tie my shoes now."
How about we get together after this trail run and check each other for ticks?
"I am a distance runner, it's all about the hips and endurance and I can do it longer."
"I am a jogger, but date me and I will never run away from you."
I am like pudding. I look like crap but I am sweet as can be!
"I am sure it is not this jog, you definitely just took my breath away."
"I do not believe in love at first sight, so babe I am going to run by you once again."
I like long runs on the beach.
I like to get really really dirty. Running on back trails in the rain is the best.
I want to pound you like I pound the asphalt for hours until it hurts.
"I will be the fireman for you tonight, cause you’re smokin’ fast!"
"I‘m no photographer, but I can picture us running together."
"I'd love to go up and down with you, fancy a hill rep session?"
I'd run miles just to be with you.
"If I am a GPS, will you take me running every day?"
"Is that a Clif Bar in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?"
Is this the registration table? Because I need a number from you.
Is your name Charity? Because my heart is racing for you.
"Join me today, because I am in it for the long run when it comes to love."
"Let me tie your running shoes, because I don't want you falling for anyone else."
Let’s kick off these running gears and I’ll show you a great time from my motion control.
"Let's do some cross training tonight, with our bodies crossed."
Let's get sweaty.
"My coach told me not to get my heart rate over 160 today, but then I screwed up when I saw you!"
My love for you is like an marathon. It goes on and on.
On a scale of 1 -10 you are a 26.2!
"Roses are red, violets are blue, would you mind if I ran with you?"
So … do you run here often?
The best stretches are partner stretches.
The only thing brighter than the sun on this track is your smile.
"Two ways to get to your target heart rate: You can either run really fast, or I can just take off my shirt."
Wanna find out what the real fourth event of triathlon is? Join my secret event.
Want to run faster? Let's strengthen our hips together!
What are your times? Because I can show you the time of your life.
"What’s your PR (Personal Record)? If you go out with me, I will break your record tonight."
"When I log my run in my journal today, it will say I ran with my future wife/husband today."
"Wow, you have really impressive forefoot strike. And I got other types of impressive strikes in bed."
You can stop running after your dreams. I am right here.
You had my heart racing from the moment I saw you running.
"You make my heart race, and there is no finish line."
You run faster than my nose in allergy season!
You run like light. How can I get high-speed access?
You’ve got more curves than a cross country track.
Your pace or mine?
Your stride is enviable. Are you a runner?
"Your voice is so beautiful, you make fartleks sound appealing."
Am I looking at a defense specialist? Because you are totally keeping the play alive.
Are you a good blocker? Because I sense a big fat tip coming.
Are you a hitter? Because I can set you up for the perfect spike.
Are you a receiver? Because I got some fast balls for you.
Are you a three-point pass? Because you're perfect.
Are you a volleyball? Because I will always dive for you.
Are you a volleyball? Because I would hit on you all night long.
Are you as good as serving your numbers like you do with volleyball?
Babe are you the hitter in volleyball? Tonight let me be the hitter instead.
Babe you are my perfect three-point pass.
"Babe, do you want me to go short or go deep?"
"Babe, get in ready position and I will spike into your net."
"Babe, I am a one man five-one team. I got five fingers and one serious dick."
"Babe, I am just into jungle ball or picnic volleyball."
"Babe, I got the flare in my pants."
"Babe, let's practice volleyball. You gotta work on your ball handling error."
"Babe, set your ass up and I'll spike that."
"By the time I am done, you won't have the power to attack block this cock."
"Darling I love seeing your boobs while playing volleyball, because I would totally hit that."
Dive for my pants and you will save some amazing balls.
Do you play volleyball? Because you look great on your knees.
"Don't be afraid of the net, we got much better protection."
Girl are you a setter? Because I'd hit that.
"Girl are you a team player, because we could assist each other for the perfect score."
Girl do you play volleyball? What is your favorite position?
"Girl even if I am a volleyball player, I won't avoid faults and pass the blame to you."
Girl I don't play no decoy game.
Girl I will try not to go for penetration.
Girl I'd like to test my bump pass with your ass.
Girl you play volleyball? Do you enjoy dive in deep or float in the shallow?
"Girl, anytime you want me to stop, just cry foul."
"Girl, are you ready to receive my point of service?"
"Girl, we'd make great doubles team."
"Girl, where do you prefer my bump? Attack line or back court?"
"Girl, you can serve to me all night long."
"Girl, you like defensive play or attack play?"
"Girl, you served an ace through my heart."
Hey Girl! Can I touch you more than 3 times?
"Hey girl, I love that you got those knee pads. You know what else you could do other than Volleyball?"
I am coming! Time to run for cover.
"I am the service winner, ready to see how I score?"
"I cannot help myself but touch you more than three times, it feels illegal."
I know just how to approach you: I will spike you hard and fast.
"I see you know how to use the block, but I will keep trying."
"If I can set you up good on the court, I'll definitely set you up in bed."
"If I serve my heart to you, would you return yours?"
"If you were a volleyball, there are so many positions that I could handle you."
"Let's set it up for the future, it's time to take the dive baby."
Look out for my power tip!
Pancakes for breakfast?
Pass your love to me and I will return it.
Serve me balls girl.
Should I go for Cross Court Shot or Cut Shot to score with you?
"Want to make a pass with me, I promise I would not hurt you one bit, you have my word on it."
We can go back to my place this night and just have fun reenacting the play you just had.
We’re not allowed to touch the volleyball more than three times but I’d love to do that to you.
"Whenever I see you dive, I get turned on, would you mind doing that for me once more, baby?"
Why set and spike when we could just bump uglies?
Why should we set and even spike if we can just bump away all the uglies we’ve been through.
Would it be okay to touch you more than 3 times?
Wow seeing you dive really turns me on.
"You are so tall I bet you play with the ball, I bet you’d love to test it out with me, right away."
"You bet I can serve as good as I can go down on my knees for a hit, want to see me do that?"
"You can do anything you want as long as you will give me a kiss after your game, okay?"
You can take me back to the bedroom if we can watch some game movies and mull them over.
"You happened to be a libero? I swear I will hit at you really hard all day long, believe me."
"You have the sass, I can see it in your hits, would you give everything you have to me now?"
"You look good on your knees I bet you give a nice hand job too, let me see that for myself."
"You look like a setter to me so it seems I cannot take you on any double date tonight, I guess."
"You look like a tight set to me, I might want to loosen you up a bit, want to see me do that?"
"You must be a pass because girl, you are just so damn perfect in every way that I can see you."
You must be a setter because you're good with your hands.
"You must be a tip because you are certainly making me go on my toes, aren’t you, baby girl?"
You must be a volleyball because baby I just want to dig you right out on this court now.
You must be the ball because I’d love to get my hands on you all over you anytime of the day.
You must be the perfect set because I hate seeing that so I’d have to smash you real hard.
You must be wearing something good cause my volleyball does not get blocked that easily!
You must got a lot of stamina as a volleyball player. Let me test your limit babe.
"You play volleyball? Let me grab some knee pads, so I can slide into your DMs."
"You saw how good I am at receiving a volleyball, I bet I can do so with your balls tonight."
"You seem to be good at volleyball and good enough to go on your knees, can I try it out."
"You seem to have great knowledge of that swing block, want to try swinging with me as well?"
"You want to play with a ball tonight but I can have an extra one for you, want to see it now?"
"You want to see more balls because you love them? You are in for a treat, I got two more!"
"You want to test the durability of the net, we can do so tonight and see what happens next."
"You want to try I campfire? Well, you are indeed hot and I do want some more of you, honey."
"You’ve got big feet, is it true that your feet is the shaft too? If so, I would love to see it now."
"You've obviously mastered the swing block, dare to try swing-dancing with me?"
"Your eyes are like a sunset, They're Beautiful, inspiring, and hard to turn away from."
"I don't know which is prettier today, the water, the sky or your eyes."
I must be lost... because I see paradise.
"I'm not a very good swimmer, do you have any lifeguard experience?"
"Nice beach balls, can I play?"
Is your name Summer? Cause you are hot!
I'll show you my tan lines if you show me yours.
"You should go in the water, cuz you're so hot you're on fire!"
I'm drowning in the sun and need mouth to mouth now!
You hear that? The ocean wants you to join me for a drink.
I barely noticed you in the winter months.
"You're so hot, the sun is jealous."
Hear that? The ocean wants you to join me for a drink.
"Your eyes are bluer than the Atlantic Ocean, and I'm lost at sea."
"I feel like I'm in Scandinavia, because when I'm with you its's like the sun never sets."
"Hey baby, the sun isn't the only thing that rises."
"Hey ladies, which way to the beach?"
Do you have any sunscreen? 'Cause you are burning me up!
My buddies bet me that I wouldn't be able to start a conversation with the most beautiful girl on the river. Wanna get a drink later with their money?
"Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I float by again?"
I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran my boat into yours. So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.
Have you ever driven a boat? Try to park it on my dock.
"Hey baby, wanna go for a ride on my big dinghy"
Would you like to sip on a margarita laying on a boat watching a sunset on a calm night?
Now get out there and pick-up your boat race sweetie!
If you were a boat I would keep you in a garage.
"Ay girl, I'd like to throw you on a trailer and haul you to the sea."
You can shiver my timbers anytime.
You'd make for some real smooth sailing
You rock my boat like captain crunch.
Nice life preservers.
Permission to board?
"Baby, you've bought yourself a cruise on the Love Boat. I'll be your captain."
Boy: Have u ever been fishing before? Girl: Why? Boy: I think we should hook up!
I don't know if you've ever been fishing but I think we should hookup
I like hookers.
Do you prefer stiff or limp rods?
Nice bobbers!
Can i put my tackle in your box?
"Excuse me, can you hold my rod?"
"You wanna come back, and see my minnows?"
I bet I could breath in them waders.
Let me see your fly box.
I've got a 9' rod.
I normally fish for trout but I'll make and exception for you.
"Driftin with an attractor like you, baby, is always 'drag free'."
You know I'm da man you been wading for.
Can you tell me the proper way to present my fly to a lady.
If you were a fly baby you'd be 'irresistible'.
Fishing with you in September is best because you can't 'run-off'.
"Is this catch and release, cause I DON'T want to let you go."
"You know, I have the longest rod on this river."
You see my friend over there trying to fly fish? [Point to friend] He wants to know if YOU think I'M cute.
(As she is leaving her fishing hole) Hey aren't you forgetting something? (What?) Me!
I always knew the best catch of my life would be on this river...
My pull buoy's not the only thing that goes between these thighs. 
Are you Swedish? 'Cause you the sweetest fish I sea.
We could make BEAUTIFUL fish together
Damn you're like an award winning bass. I dunno whether to mount you or eat you.
Wanna come back to my place and scrub algae?
Could you hold my eel? He is a slippery little fucker.
How aboat you come back to my place and check out my huge tank
Can i fish in your pond?
"You can call me Nemo, because I'm never afraid to touch the butt."
Can you call a lifeguard? Because I'm drowning in your eyes...
Don't save me just yet. Let me go down a few times.
I can't swim! Can I hold on to your floaties?
I perform best when I'm wet.
"Do you have a sunburn, or are you always this hot?"
How was your last skinny dip? I bet I can make your next one better.
"I wish I'd brought my towel, can I share yours?"
"I hope you know CPR, because you are taking my breath away."
Is your name summer? Because you are hot!
You make my heart slip 'n slide.
Ignore the ray bans. There is nothing shade-y about me.
Does this rag smell like chloroform to you?
I really like your suit.
Are you a low interval sprint set? ‘Cause you're making my face all red.
"You're like the anti-fog spray for my goggles, you just brighten up my day. "
I could put some motion in your ocean.
You've got the fanciest fantail I've ebber seen.
So you're mermaid huh? I take it you are very accustomed to seamen then?
"Excuse me, do I need to buy a ticket for your fantastic voyage?"
"I'm a Love Pirate, and I'm here for your booty! ARRRGGGHHH!!!"
Can I see your tan lines?
"I know they say there's plenty of fish in the sea, but I think you're my nemo."
I'm about to dive into the sea...that pu-sea
The way your mask leaves those lines on your face is soooo sexy! 
"I'm either bent or in love, sweetheart, because when I see you I get all tingly."
Can you believe they still kill dolphins in some countries? 
Voulez-vous plongez avec moi? 
I'm tired of one-dive stands — I'm looking for some meaningful buddy breathing. 
That wetsuit would look great on my floor! 
"Tan line from a wedding ring? No, that's just mysterious underwater coral bleaching. "
"Pardon me, when you walked by my mouth went dry ... could you spit in my mask for me? "
Of course it's for science! We're all gonna be living down here one day!! 
Is that a mirror in your pocket? Because I can really see myself in your wetsuit. 
Nice tanks
Rebreather divers go down deeper and stay longer
Cave divers like tight wet holes 
"I hear scuba diving does a body good. Wow, you must dive A LOT!"
How long do you usually go down for?
Was your dad Neptune? 'Cause I think you are a mermaid.
Your eyes are the same colour as my wetsuit.
I got the boat. You got the harbor. What say we tie up for the night?
"If I follow you, will you keep me?"
Are you a rescue diver? Please rescue me by coming back to my place later.
I'm a single diver.
I'm narked.
"Hey babe, do you know that my mouth can generate over 750 psi?"
Can I take your photo angelfish?
"Will you go diving with me in the morning, should I phone you or just nudge you?"
Do you believe in penetration on the first dive?
Is that a giant triton shell in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?
I was holding my dive computer when I realized I'd rather be holding you.
Do you have a map to this dive site? 'Cause I keep getting lost in your eyes.
Blow bubbles if you want to sleep with me.
That's a nice wetsuit. Can I talk you out of it?
That wetsuit would look great on the floor next to my bed.
Do you believe that size doesn't matter only the expansion rate?
Can I go down with you?
"Are you a surfboard?, cause you look like you need a waxing before I can take a ride."
I love the way the ocean pounds the surf.
Your surfboard is so big!
Can I swim in your eyes on a hot summer day?
"Hey girl, you make my heart flutter kick."
I never have a false start.
Do you have swimmers as good as China? We'll have to do something about that...
"Man, you have to be a swimmer, because you blow everyone else out of the water with your good looks!"
They called me the human torpedo even before I took up swimming.
"I've never won gold in the breast stroke, but that could all change tonight."
"Hey girl, is your name 400 IM? 'Cause you took my breath away."
"If you got out with me, I can get you Michael Phelps' phone number."
"Hey girl, I'd swim across the ocean just to see you smile."
"Hey girl, I'd swim up to 800 meters for your love."
"Hey girl, lane lines can't keep us apart."
"People tell me I have a good breaststroke, but I'd say I'm a pretty good swimmer too."
You really flipturn me on.
"Girl, you give me the butterflies."
Are you the splash-and-dash because you've got my heart beating.
I'm Ryan Lochte. She tells you you're not. I'm Nathan Adrian. Again she calls your bluff. Keep going until you find a swimmer that she'll believe.
"Here's a fun game, you be the Titanic and I'll be the iceberg hitting on you."
"And you're here in my heart. And my heart will go on and on. Seriously, until you go out with me I'll keep singing"
"You would have survived the Titanic sinking, you're my better half."
"Near, far, wherever you are – as long as it's in the same zip code."
We should go practice never letting go.
"I know you said you didn't want to go out, but you know what, they said the Titanic was unsinkable. I'll pick you up at 8."
"I know you're out of my league, but I show you below decks if you show me steerage."
I can't stop sinking a boat you.
"You shouldn't care that I'm broke. Didn't you see Titanic, the poor people had way more fun, up until they all drowned."

ls there a rainbow today'? I just found the treasure I've been searching for!
My nickname in high school was Butt Warmer.
My umbrella will keep you dry but I'll keep you wet.
My! Your parcels are buoyant.
My! Your tornado is long.
Nice mammatus.
Nice pair of 88D's.
"No relationship is all sunshine, but two people can share one umbrella and survive the storm together."
"Oh, your lips are sunburned, let me help them."
One look at you and my barometric pressure rises.
Plow here often?
"Put on some SPF 30+, so I can get to irradiating you."
"Screw me if I'm wrong, but it's freezing in Phoenix."
She acts like summer and walks like rain.
Skittles the way to taste the rainbow.

Take it easy on me -- I'm a virga.
That wasn't my hand..it was my El Nino.
That’s a crazy burn line. How far up does it go?
"The Arizona desert's full of cacti, but I've got the biggest prick."
The only thing hotter than today is your body.
The snow is blowing. How about you?
"The storm is going to cause serious flooding, ever done it underwater?"
"The storm suppose to knock out the power, but your eyes have all the electricity I need."
There a cold front coming…but I’m gonna keep your front warm.

Tonight's forecast is a blizzard of me heading towards your face.
Tonight's forecast: 100% chance of love.
"Trust me, hang with me and I'll name a hurricane after you."
Wanna see my weather weenie?

"Want to compare tan lines, or just show me yours?"
Want to know the difference between me and my Storm? It only takes two minutes to get me up and running

What’s your “do” point?
When you do it with me it’s like winter on Mt. Charleston…expect a lot of the white stuff.
Who needs a sled when you can just ride me?
Why do you need to buy extra batteries? I have 2 flashlights and can please you til the sun comes up.
Will you come to my place? You can sure lower my heating bill with your hotness.
Would you like to blow my weather vane?
You advect my moisture.

You are so hot. The sun is jealous.
"You can call me rain, because I'm going to be getting you wet tonight."
You can stand under my umbrella.
You give me a high pressure system…in my pants.
"You just caused a heat wave, because that's how hot you are."
You know that 6 inches of rain we got this morning...guess how I measured it?!
You know that during a tornado warning that the safest place to be is in my bed.

And who wears turtlenecks anymore?
Are you passed out on the sidewalk or are you my snow angel?
Are you sitting on a candle? Because your booty is on fire.
"Baby, you're so hot I only need four layers."
Black ice isn't the only thing I'm falling for.

"Hey girl, wanna hiber-mate?"
"Hey, let me take you out on a first date in the snow—I promise I’m not a flake-y person."
"How about you let me take you for a ride in my bobsled? And by bobsled, I mean bed."
I can tell you’re quite the elf-a male.

"I love winter, because it's an excuse to cuddle."
I saw you from across the room and winter fall in love with you.
"I take romance to a new level—I don’t cuddle, I hibernate."
I took the liberty of defrosting your windshield while you getting ready for work this morning.
"I wasn't joking, I think an icicle fell in your pants."
I'd like to hibermate with you.
I'll give you a real reason to wear that ugly turtleneck.
"I'm going to go ahead and call you ""winter"" 'cause pretty soon you'll be coming."
I'm looking to get bobsleigh'd tonight.
I'm no weatherman but you can expect more than a few inches tonight
I've become frostsmitten with you.
"I’m wearing a lot of layers, want to watch me undress for twelve minutes?"
"If you think that's impressive, you should see how many inches I just accumulated in my pants."
"If you were a DEER, I'd never try to REIN you in. Because I respect you as an individual person with your own hopes and dreams. Do you want to go discuss our independent plans for the future? Maybe read some Margaret Atwood? I value your opinion."
"If you were a tree, you’d be an evergreen, because I bet you look this good year-round."

Is your name winter? Because you will be coming soon.
Leave with me and I'll close your school tomorrow!
"Let's add this log to the fire. Oh wait, that's just my penis."
My love for you will last forever… green. Like the trees.
My nickname in high school was Butt Warmer.
Plow here often?
"Seriously, it's weird that you haven't taken the icicle out of your pants yet. It's starting to melt… aren't you cold?"
The snow is blowing. How about you?

Will you come to my place? You can sure lower my heating bill with your hotness.
"Winter is coming, so am I."
You and this weather have one thing in common. You're both frigid.
You are so hot that even on a cold winter night my penis would stand for you.
"You must be a frozen pond, because I can see myself skeeting all over you."
"You're just like a snowflake: Beautiful, unique, and with one touch you'll be wet."

Do you have water wings? Because I think heaven is missing an angel who can't swim very well.
Do you like this string bikini made from recycled polyester?
Do you love hot summer knights? Because I’m killer at Dungeons and Dragons.
Don’t sweat the petty things. Pet the sweaty things.
Everything around here reminds me of beach balls.
